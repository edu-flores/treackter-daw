A react-based app for creating beats in your browser. Start with a simple idea and let it evolve into something bigger on the go.

<br>

* Master volume

* 3 different sound kits

* Random beat generator
* Import/export track

<br>

## 💻 Usage

Use your keyboard or mouse to play samples in the top soundboard. This will help you come up with ideas for creating a track.

In the bottom timeline, select which pads to activate in your four-bar loop. Each instrument can be soloed, muted and its volume & panning can also be adjusted with the knobs on the right.

To customize your beat, you can select a BPM that best suits your current idea. Also, the master volume can be modified in the same section.

Finally, you can name and save your project. This will generate a `.beat` file that can later be uploaded in the same page.
